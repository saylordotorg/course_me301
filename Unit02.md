**Unit 2: Graphical and Tabular Data Presentation** <span
id="2"></span> 
*Standard styles for presenting data in graphical and tabular form have
evolved over time for efficiency of data communication.  Contemporary
computer tools for data presentation allow us to use such styles in
order to generate graphics.  Even with these tools, the user must still
determine the most appropriate format for conveying the desired
information and appropriately labeling the graphic.  This unit will
introduce several formats for concise data presentation that will be
useful in subsequent work.*  
  
 *The information presented in this unit should supplement your
coursework in* [*ME304: Engineering
Communication*](../../courses/me304/) *and* [*ME101: Introduction to
Mechanical Engineering.*](../../courses/me101/)*  For complex graphics,
you should refer to* [*ME101: Introduction to Mechanical
Engineering*](../../courses/me101/)*, but one message bears repeating:
title and caption all graphics, label all axes, provide a key for all
symbols, and specify whether error bars are one or two standard
deviations.*  
  
 *You probably have access to several utilities for creating graphical
presentations of data.  The list below contains topics that you should
explore in your own graphical data analysis utility.  As a start, you
may wish to read or refer to one or more of the following.* *After you
have skimmed these resources, you should review them to make sure that
you have a grasp of the following concepts.  You should practice using
each of the ideas below in a computer environment of your choice.*

     Instructions: If in need of inspiration for graphical analysis and
    presentation of data, it may be helpful to refer to the linked
    material above.  Many of the plotting techniques are useful for very
    specific experimental situations.  You may wish to skim through a
    few of the descriptions to get a feel for the types of plots that
    other people have used.

     Instructions: Read this (tongue-in-cheek) document.  Although many
    of the tips may seem obvious, it is important to have such a list of
    common errors in mind when creating a graph for a document in the
    late stages of preparation, when all participants are tired and the
    thinking may not be clear.
