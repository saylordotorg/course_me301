**Unit 7: Force, Torque, and Pressure Measurements** <span
id="7"></span> 
*Force, torque, and pressure measurements can be related by temporal and
geometric coupling.  Consider the schematic of a see-saw balance.*  *The
relative masses of objects M1 and M2 can be determined by the torques
they exert about point P at different distances (L1 and L2) from that
point under the acceleration of gravity g.  Many more sophisticated
geometries and sensing arrangements can be coupled to allow measurements
of related quantities.  In this unit, you will review some of the common
configurations for such measurements.*

**Unit 7 Time Advisory**

*Note: These concepts arise from Bernoulli’s equation.  They are not to
be confused with Gauge and Absolute pressures.  Gauge pressure is the
system pressure minus some reference (atmospheric pressure).*
