**Unit 8: Temperature Measurements** <span id="8"></span> 
*Temperature control is fundamental to most chemical, biological, and
mechanical processes.  In order to determine which temperature sensor or
transducer is appropriate for a given situation, you must consider a
number of factors, including operating environment and desired temporal
and measurement sensitivity.  In this unit, you will review common
temperature scales and the characteristics of commonly-used temperature
measuring devices.*

**Unit 8 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 12 hours to complete.

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Demonstrate use of common temperature scales.
-   Demonstrate knowledge of the relative merits of common
    instrumentation, including expansion thermometers, thermocouples,
    and thermistors.
-   Experiment with the dynamics of a temperature sensor, analyze data,
    and formulate conclusions.

     Instructions: Read the text and then calculate the following: room
    and body temperature in degrees Fahrenheit, Centigrade, Kelvin, and
    Rankine.  What is the meaning of negative absolute temperature?

**8.2 Expansion Thermometers** <span id="8.2"></span> 
*Note: You are probably familiar with the liquid-in-glass expansion
thermometer, although its use is declining with time.  You may have
encountered one in a chemistry laboratory, in cooking candy, or for a
body temperature measurement.  Another type of expansion thermometer
makes use of the differential expansion of two metals and is hence
called a bimetallic expansion thermometer.  These have been used in
devices like thermostats, in which some mechanical action is required as
a function of temperature.*

    wide-ranging, but is particularly useful for understanding the
    physics of liquid and gas expansion thermometers.
