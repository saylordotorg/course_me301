**Unit 9: Dynamic Measurements and Control** <span id="9"></span> 
*In this unit, you will implement what you learned in previous units to
make dynamic measurements and use these measurements in order to control
a piece of equipment.  In lieu of performing the actual exercise, you
will write a detailed procedure and submit hypothetical data for two of
the following topics.  The topics are intentionally open-ended so that
you have the freedom to define the problem as your resources permit.
 Each report should consist of the following elements.*  

*9a.       Introduction: Explain the exercise in the broader context of
mechanical engineering.*  
 *9b.       Purpose: Briefly explain the specific, limited objectives of
the exercise.*  
 *9c.       Equipment:  Where possible, list commercially-available
equipment, complete with all available specifications.*  
 *9d.       Procedure*  
 *9e.       Theory: Outline the physical basis for the measurements and
the details of data analysis.*  
 *9f.        Hypothetical Data: Generate hypothetical data, complete
with estimated errors.*  
 *9g.       Analysis of Data and Presentation of Results*  
 *9h.       Recommendations for Future Experimenters*

**Unit 9 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 27 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 9.1: 9 hour  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.2: 9 hours  
  
 ☐    Subunit 9.3: 9 hours

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Present engineering data and other information in graphical and/or
    tabular format.
-   Use automated systems for data acquisition and analysis for
    engineering systems.
-   Use elementary concepts of physics to analyze engineering situations
    and data.
-   Summarize and present experimental design, implementation, and data
    in written format.
-   Use new technology and resources to design and perform experiments
    for engineering analysis.

**9.1 Dynamic Strain Measurements** <span id="9.1"></span> 
*Instructions: Design an apparatus that can observe the oscillations
that occur when a cantilevered beam is suddenly loaded with a weight. 
You may use commercially available strain gauges.*

**9.2 Accelerometry** <span id="9.2"></span> 
*Instructions: Design an apparatus to measure the acceleration that
occurs when a stationary object is suddenly hit by a moving object
(e.g.  a mass swinging from a pendulum).*

**9.3 Temperature Control of a Light Bulb** <span id="9.3"></span> 
*Instructions:An incandescent light bulb dissipates most of its energy
as heat.  By adjusting the duty cycle of the bulb (i.e. by turning it on
and off to control the amount of heat dissipated), one can control the
temperature of the surface of the bulb.  It is your task to choose an
appropriate temperature sensor and design a feedback control algorithm
to keep the surface temperature at a set point by adjusting the amount
of time that the bulb is lit versus dark.*
