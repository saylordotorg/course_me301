**Unit 5: Measurements of Linear Dimension** <span id="5"></span> 
*The measurement of length is as fundamental to mechanical engineering
as it is to everyday life (consider the variety of length scales we use
on a day-to-day basis: the hand, finger, foot, rod, nose, and hair!) 
Coupled with other information, length measurements can yield complex
geometric information.  In this unit, you will learn about a few tools
that enable us to precisely measure lengths and related quantities over
vastly different length scales.  Many more tools are available than can
be described here.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Understand, use, and convert various common units for length
    measurement.
-   Research and understand modern instrumentation for length
    measurements.
-   Communicate technical information to others.

    Chemistry Virtual Textbook: “Understanding the Units of Scientific
    Measurement”**

     Instructions: Review this chapter, focusing on the short section on
    length.  Note that there may be an error in the figure on length
    scales regarding the size of a hydrogen atom.  Look up the size
    elsewhere and compare.  To view in a PDF file, scroll to the bottom

**5.2 Calipers** <span id="5.2"></span> 
*Note: Calipers are claw-like devices used for measuring linear
dimension.  They are particularly useful for measuring the outer
diameters of cylindrical or round objects or the internal diameters of
pipes and the like.  They are one of the few instruments that still
makes use of Vernier scales.*

-   **Reading: University of Toronto: David Harrison’s “Reading a
    Vernier Caliper”**

    Caliper](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ME301-5.2.pdf)”(PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read this discussion of the Vernier scale and test
    your knowledge with the Java applet.  If you have access to a set of
    calipers, you may wish to practice with measuring the thickness of a
    series of nominally identical coins.

     Instructions: View this slide show, which demonstrates the use of a
    sine bar for measuring angles.  The sine bar is often used in
    conjunction with gauge blocks in machine shops for precise
    manufacturing of equipment.  You may wish to review the trigonometry
    involved in the use of sine bars.

**5.4 Instrumentation** <span id="5.4"></span> 
-   **Activity: The Saylor Foundation’s Instrumentation Activity**
    Instructions: Modern instrumentation is capable of precise and
    accurate measurements of lengths over many length scales.  The most
    current information about commercially available instrumentation is
    readily accessible via informational advertisements on
    [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/).  For each of the following items
    (5.4.1-5.4.5 listed below), review at least one such advertisement
    and answer the following questions:  
        
     1.      What are the technical capabilities of the instrument?  
     2.      What is the cost of the instrument?  
     3.      What is the level of training required to operate and
    obtain meaningful data from the instrument?  
     4.      What types of systems are amenable to study by the
    instrument?  
        
     In your search, you may find many other types of instrumentation
    for similar purposes with slightly different names.  The list bellow
    will help you get you started.  
        
     Example: Type “profilometer” into the YouTube search window and
    peruse the resulting product videos.
