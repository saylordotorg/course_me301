**Unit 3: Electrical Circuits and Measurements** <span id="3"></span> 
*A review of* *basic circuit principles and measurements is included
here for completeness, but you should refer to* [*PHYS102: Introduction
to Electromagnetism*](../../courses/me006/) *for a discussion of the
fundamental physics.   In this unit, you will review elementary concepts
of circuit analysis for utility in signal transduction, conditioning,
and measurement.*  
  
 *Note: Much of the material in Units 3 and 4 are interdependent and
refer you to discussion available in the resource “*[*All About
Circuits*](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/index.html)*”; you are
encouraged to peruse that resource in full at your own pace if you do
are not familiar enough with concepts in electrical engineering to
understand the material as it is presented here.  In addition, many of
the sections in “*[*All About
Circuits*](http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_3/index.html)*” contain
example problems that you should follow and review for particular
emphasis.*  
  
 *Note: There is a review quiz for both Units 3 and 4 at the end of Unit
4.*
