This course will serve as your introduction to working in an engineering
laboratory.  You will learn to gather, analyze, interpret, and explain
physical measurements for simple engineering systems in which only a few
factors need be considered.  This experience will be crucial to your
success in analyzing more complicated systems in subsequent coursework
and in the practice of mechanical engineering. We frequently encounter
measurement systems in our everyday lives.  Consider the following
examples: 1.      The many gauges found on the control panel of a motor
vehicle indicate vehicle speed, engine coolant temperature, transmission
setting, cabin temperature, engine speed, and oil pressure—amongst many
other measurements. 2.      A routine visit to a physician often entails
several measurements of varying complexity—internal temperature, blood
pressure, internal appearance, heart rate, respiration rate, and tissue
texture, amongst many, many more. 3.      The experienced cook may use
several measurements to successfully “cook until done”—for example, he
or she might measure internal temperature, external coloration, external
temperature and exposure time, internal coloration, aroma, and texture.
Any one of these measurement systems may require substantial attention
to detail.  Consider the elaborate ritual of procedure that occurs next
time you have your blood pressure measured in a routine physical
examination.  Or perhaps observe the careful baker measuring the
temperature in the final stages of baking.  You might ask: “What type of
thermometer is used?  How large is the probe?  What is the response time
of the probe (how long do we have to let it equilibrate for each
measurement)?  What is the accuracy of the measurement?  What is the
precision of the measurement?  Where in the product are the measurements
taken?  How many measurements are taken?  How are the measurements
recorded?  And finally, what possible actions might be taken as a result
of those measurements?” The primary purpose of this course is not to
make you an expert at all types of measurements important to mechanical
engineering, but rather to expose you to the use and analysis of a few
such techniques so that you may readily adapt new techniques as
appropriate in subsequent coursework and in your engineering career. 
Each section of this course is accompanied by hands-on or virtual
exercises.  The units of this course are intended to stand alone, but
you may find it worthwhile to revisit previous sections and exercises
after completing later sections of the course.

### Learning Outcomes

### Course Requirements

In order to take this course you must:  
    
 √    Have access to a computer.  
    
 √    Have continuous broadband Internet access.  
    
 √    Have the ability/permission to install plug-ins or software (e.g.,
Adobe Reader or Flash).  
    
 √    Have the ability to download and save files and documents to a

### Course Information

Welcome to **ME301:** **Measurement & Experimentation Laboratory**.
General information about this course and its requirements can be found
below.  
  
 **Course Designer:** [Dr. Steve
Gibbs](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrSteveGibbs)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course comprises a range of different free,
online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following:  

-   All About Circuits
-   [NIST/SEMATECH’s e-Handbook of Statistical Methods
    (2010)](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ME301-1.1.pdf)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned material.
All units build on previous units, so it will be important to progress
through the course in the order presented.  
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your Final Exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assessments at the end of each unit in this course.   
  
 In order to *pass* this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.   
    
 **Time Commitment:** This course should take you a total of
approximately 111 hours to complete. Each unit includes a time advisory
that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit
and assignment. These time advisories should help you plan your time
accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at the time advisories
before beginning this course in order to determine how much time you
have over the next few weeks to complete each unit. Then, you can set
goals for yourself. For example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 19
hours to complete. Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and
decide to complete Subunit 1.1 (a total of 4 hours) on Monday night,
Subunit 1.2 (a total of 6 hours) on Tuesday and Subunit 1.3 and 1.4 (3
hours) on Wednesday night, etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It is extremely important that you give each
assignment the amount of reading and review necessary to grasp the main
points and lines of enquiry.  Also, on completing the assessments, take
a moment to consider how the materials you have just studied relate to
the topics covered in previous sections of the course.
