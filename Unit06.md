**Unit 6: Time Measurements** <span id="6"></span> 
*Throughout history, we have marked time by the motion of objects in the
sky that indicate the passage of hours, days, months, and years.  More
accurate measures of time gradually emerged in response to the demands
of navigation, commerce, communications, and curiosity.  Today, atomic
clocks operate with a time resolution of one part in 10<sup>15</sup>.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn about standards of time measurement, the
limits of human reaction times, and the practical limits of precise time
measurement via readily available, computer-based sensors.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you 5 hours to complete.

☐    Subunit 6.1: 2 hours

☐    Subunit 6.2: 2 hours

☐    End of Unit Self-Assessment: 1 hour

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the limitations of human- and
    machine-based time measurements.
-   Demonstrate knowledge of the time scales of common physical and
    chemical processes.

**6.1 Human Reaction Times** <span id="6.1"></span> 
*Note: When performing any physical measurement, you must know the
limits of the measurement system you are using.  Here, we will briefly
explore the limits of human reaction times.*

**6.1.1 Dropping Meter Stick Exercise** <span id="6.1.1"></span> 
*Instructions: Estimate the time required for a person to let go of a
meter stick and grasp it again by measuring the distance that the meter
stick falls under the acceleration of gravity.  You will need to use
Newton’s laws and some simple calculations to determine that d=
at<sup>2</sup>/2 where d = the distance dropped, t= the reaction time,
and a= the acceleration of gravity.  Repeat the measurement several
times for several different individuals.  Calculate statistics (e.g. 
means, standard deviations).*

**6.1.2 Flashing Light Exercise** <span id="6.1.2"></span> 
*Instructions: Estimate human reaction time by performing a computer-
based reaction time test (i.e. press a mouse button when the light
flashes).  Compute the mean reaction time for an individual and the
standard deviation of reaction times for that individual.  Compare that
reaction time with the one determined from the meter-stick experiment.*

     Instructions: Perform the reaction time test at least five times. 
    Calculate the mean and standard deviation.  How does this time
    differ from the one calculated in 5.1.1.
